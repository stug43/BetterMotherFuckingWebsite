		<aside>or 'MyMotherFuckingWebsite' V2</aside>
		<h2>A little bit of CSS can't be too harmful</h2>
		<h3>See how this 'h3' title looks great</h3>
		<p>With some classes applied to the brut html file, you can easily pass from the perfect older version of this website to this more perfect motherfucking website. And remember: <strong>Doing too much is for under pressure people</strong>, we don't need this kind of shit.<br />
		This website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Still is easy to load, even on your cellular phone using the 1.5G</li>
			<li>Still is 'responsive', or something like that</li>
			<li>Still is simple as fuck</li>
			<li>Still is accesible to blind people</li>
			<li>Still is MY production, I still can't copy someone else production</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You might won't believe it, but</p>
		<h3>It didn't take me more time than the precedent</h3>
		<p>Indeed, to create a CSS file and link it to yout html page it only takes you a couple of minutes if you're not the village idiot <br />
		Here are some advices to help you no to create a shitty website</p>
		<h2>Let it breathe</h2>
		<p>Come on, it is elementary! You don't want your web site to look like <a href="https://siphawaii.com/">this one</a>... So you know what you have to do. You don't see? choose a minimum line-height of 1.4 for the body.</p>
		<h2>Choose your colors with attention</h2>
		<p>If you wake up one day, deciding that your life is made for the green, that on your website, #009900 green letters would be nice on a magnificient #009933 green background, stop everything, even breathe!<br />
		more seriously, reducing a little bit the contrast makes your website more pleasant to read.
		<h2>Don't spread your lines on kilometers, it's not a fucking fresco</h2>
		<p>have really I to say more about it?</p>
